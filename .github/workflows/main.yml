# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Install Build Framework
        shell: pwsh
        run: Install-Module -Force InvokeBuild

      # Runs a single command using the runners shell
      - name: Build
        shell: pwsh
        run: Invoke-Build build
  test:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Test
        shell: pwsh
        run: Invoke-Build test
